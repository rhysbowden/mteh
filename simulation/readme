msteh4.R: Main file. 
The relevant results variables are: bar_hat_var_theta_hatMS which gives the empirical mean of the estimated variance of the treatment effect estimator; and th_misspec_var which gives the theoretical approximation to that value for the estimator given in the paper. These are vectors, one value for each tuple of parameters. 

msteh_disinv.R:
Disinvestment in weekend allied health services example. 
Uses data from T. P. Haines et al., Impact of disinvestment from weekend allied health services across acute medical and surgical wards: 2 stepped-wedge cluster randomised controlled trials, https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1002412#sec019
Requires an xlsx of the patient-level data to be in the same directory, https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002412.s002
